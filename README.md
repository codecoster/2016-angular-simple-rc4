# Testing with NetBeans, Angular 2 and TypeScript
This project demonstrates integration of the Karma test runner in NetBeans in combination with Jasmine, Angular 2 and the everlaw TypeScript plugin for development of Angular 2 aplications.

The following features are demonstrated
* Compile on save with everlaw nbts plugin
* Transpilation with npm and tsc
* Unit testing with Jasmine, Karma and NetBeans GUI support
* TypeDoc documentation

## Showcase
To show Angular2 and Karma testing features a very simple example was chosen:
An Component calling out the text which was given to an input field. Additionally, a button can enable and disable the output.
The Component is tested for its initialization state and klick-interaction with the button.

## Running
Please install the everlaw ntbs Plugin from https://github.com/Everlaw/nbts

Afterwards run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.
